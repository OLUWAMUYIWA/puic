## Program Spec
## PUIC Holidays

PUIC Holidays has commissioned you to write a program that will help customers to search for a particular package holiday that they would like to book this year. Package holidays are available in many different countries and 3 different packages are available; 
	A 3-day mini break = £199 per person.

	A 7-day all-inclusive holiday = £599 per person

	A 14 day senior citizens (over age 60 years) all-inclusive special available January 1st to April 30th only = £699 per person.

In this task you need to;

	Greet the customer, welcoming them to the website and ask if they would like to search for a holiday today.

	If the input is ‘N’ your program should terminate, if the input is ‘Y’ then your program should continue.

	You should then ask the user to ‘log in’. The log in details consist of an 8-letter username and 6-digit numerical password, which you have already supplied to them. You must check that they are in the correct format before allowing them access!
    
    The user should then be able to view a list of the holiday destinations available or search for the particular holiday destination that they would like.

	You should store the holiday destinations in an array or array list; I would suggest 15 to 20 different countries of your choice. Just use the country’s name do not worry about the resort.

	When the user finds the destination that they prefer they should be able to reserve the holiday and choose the dates they would like to rent it from – you need to calculate the correct fee payable using the dates chosen and verify their age if necessary.

	Please do not forget to check that the dates are valid and if the person is over age 60!

	You should then tell the user that their holiday has been reserved and that payment should be made to PUIC Holidays within 7 days.
